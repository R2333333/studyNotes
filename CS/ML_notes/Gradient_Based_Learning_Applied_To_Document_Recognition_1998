Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition:
    Good at word recognition than charater recognition

    A fully connected of sufficient size can produce invariant output with variant input:
        allows Distortion, Shift and scales (Le-Net5)
    
    Feature maps shift the same amount as the input shift
        shift and distort to build the robustness
        
    The exact location of the features is less important than its approximate location:
        for example: if the a horizontal segment on left top, a corner at up right, 
        and a vertical segment at the bottom can tell us it's a seven.

        The precies position may be humful, since the position varies in handwritting

        Can be solved by adding a subsampling layour to reduce the solution

    Used maximum likelihood estimation for loss function, which in this experiment equivalent to minimum mean square erro.
        problems:
            1. allows a trivial but unacceptable solution
            2. no competition between classes
        
        could be solve with techniques like  particular sigmoid and weight initialization

    Distortion on the input data lowered the test error from 0.95% to 0.8%
