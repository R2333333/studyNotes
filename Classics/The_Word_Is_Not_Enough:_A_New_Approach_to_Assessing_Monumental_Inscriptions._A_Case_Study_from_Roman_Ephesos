Ancient epitaphes are hard for modern scholars to read. 
Not not caused by the barriers between ancient Latin and modern languages, 
  but also due to 
	the odd breaks in the lines, 
	the lack of spaces, 
	and the strange use of punctuation.

The space using (the layout) can be either functional or decorative.
	e.g. Important name could be curved using the largest font at prominent positions.
		Names of guilty people could be ereased and written in a smaller font.
		
The content written in Latin and Greek could present very different meaning 
  on the same stone of a billingual inscription. One may understand the meaning
  of other language without literature knowladge, with the architecture and sculpture.
