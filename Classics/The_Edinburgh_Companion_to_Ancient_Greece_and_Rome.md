Why inscribe:

	Amount of Latin inscripitions peaks in 3rd centery AD.

	Commemorative (could be reversed by erasing names

	The actual process ofinscribing was itself an element in the observation of cult.

	Symbolic and administrative functions

	Epigraphical culture depended largely upon the assumption that some people would read an inscription

	The assumption is problematic since some of the inscriptions are hard to read (due to the layout)

	Many inscriptions had administrative and economic functions

	Graffiti can carry meaning

	
Modern responses to ancient inscriptions

	Some are used for polical purpose

Dangers faced by the modern ancient historian

	They cannot be regarded as impartial historical documents,
	Inscriptions were not only set up in a selective way,they also survive in a selective way.

	Inscriptions are often found in fragments, and the missing words are completed by editors.
