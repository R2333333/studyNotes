# What is Software Engineering? Why is it necessary?
 Activities of: Modeling, Problem Solving, and Knowledge acquisition.
 A realiable process of building softwares.
 
 It is necessary because we need to build a realiable and motifiable system.
 
 Two aspect: Technical aspect and Menagement aspect
 
 # Modeling
 Model is a virtual representation of the part of the real world that we are going to build.
 
 Why Build models:
    To get better idea of how to build the real system and clearify the details of the system.
    (Since the real system could be too big or too complex for us to understand it as a whole stuff)
    
 Traceability:
    The requirment need to be able to be tracked throught the entire developement process.
    (If something in the system need to be changed, we need to know what else relating to this part also need to change)
    
 # Software Development Life Circle
 1. Requirement Elicitation : produces the requirement 
 2. Requirement Analysis: produces the 
 3. High Level System Design
 4. Detailed Object Design
 5. Implementation
 6. Testing
 7. Dployment and Maintenance
