Address Space(abstraction): Contains all of the memory state of the running program
  * all memory location showed to programmers are virtual
  
    Code: 
        at top of the memory, as it won't grow 
    Heap:
        sit after code, grows downward
    Stack:
        sit at the bottom, grows upward
    Virtualizing Memory:
        the OS maps virturl address into physical location

Goal of Memory Virtualization:
    Transperancy:
        to make software doesn't realize the memory virtualization
    Efficiency:
        make processes run efficently both in time and space
    Protection:
        protect processes from other processes and the OS itself, to make sure the process
          doesn't effect or be effected by other processes
