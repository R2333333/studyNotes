Knowladge Based System:

	Build up a knowladge system and searching answers form the database.
	Limited useage:
		Cannot understand "a man shaving"

Machine Learning:
	
	Able to extract pattern form row data.
	Depends on data presentation.
		(e.g. Cartesian or Polor coordinates)
	
	Representation Learning:
		Learns not only the features but also the data representation it self.
		(e.g. Auto-Encoder)

	Factor of Variation:
		Simplest features of the target

	Deep Learning:
		Introduces representations by using simpler ones.

	Multilayer Perception:
		Methametial functions maping presentations

 	Mearsuring Depth of Model:
		Longest sequencial instructions need to be done.
		Depth of the graph decribing how things are related.

	Learning Model:
		f(x,w) = x1*w1+x2*w2+...+xn*wn
		Has limitations like: cannot represent XOR

	Reforcement Learning:
		Learning by trails and errors, without human guidance.
